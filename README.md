## Getting Started

[TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/) (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first full-stack AI Agentic Quality Engineering platform that empowers teams to test intelligently, smarter, and ship faster. Built for scale, it offers a full-stack testing cloud with 10K+ real devices and 3,000+ browsers. With AI-native test management, MCP servers, and agent-based automation, TestMu AI supports Selenium, Appium, Playwright, and all major frameworks.

With TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest), you can run Mocha Add Extension Tests across real browsers and operating systems.

- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).
- Follow the [TestMu AI Documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/) for the full setup walkthrough.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (latest stable)
- A TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) account with your username and access key

# Steps:
## Step 1: Get the zip file (Skip this if you already have the zip file with you)

Note: You will need the Chrome Extensions's ID for this. I am referring it to as $ID$. You can get the $ID$ from the URL of the Chrome Extension page.
1. Install your desired chrome extension on chrome.
2. Go to Chrome's Extensions page (chrome://extensions/), Enable the developer mode (check the developer mode box) and take note of the ID for your desired extension.
3. Your extension will be located at:

For Unix, ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/$ID$

For Windows, C:\Users\<Your_User_Name>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\$ID$

For OSX, ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/$ID$

## Step 2: Upload the zip file to TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) using API

1. Use the TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) extension upload API to upload the zip file to the backend.

2. Copy the link to your extension which will look something like - https://automation-prod-user-files.s3.amazonaws.com/extensions/orgId-XXXX/2.1.0_0.zip

## Step 3: Pass extension in capabilities

In `conf/single.conf.js` file, you need to update your capabilities. The capabilities object in the for the adding extension  are defined as:
```js
exports.capabilities = {
        'build': 'Mocha-Selenium-Sample', //Build name
        'name': 'Your Test Name', // Test name
        'platform':'Windows 10', // OS name
        'browserName': 'chrome', // Browser name
        'version': 'latest', // Browser version
        'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
        'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
        'console':false, // To capture console logs.
        'tunnel': false, // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
        "lambda:loadExtension": "https://automation-prod-user-files.s3.amazonaws.com/extensions/orgId-XXXX/2.1.0_0.zip"
};
```

## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.

Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI

In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.

As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.

That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm. 

What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
